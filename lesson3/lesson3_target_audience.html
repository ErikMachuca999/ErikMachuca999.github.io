        <h2>Two Personas:</h2>
        <p>Jim:<br>
            I am a wanderer. I've been around more than 1 block. I tell ya, there are places<br>
            I've gone to, and really wished I had an umbrella or coat. A nice Heads up would<br>
            spare me some grumbles and groans. And this is perfect as I travel through Preston,<br>
            and sometimes end up staying for a time.
        </p>

        <p>Lydia:<br>
            I live in Preston, and I have a family farm of Apple Orchards and Many Veggies, and Livestock.<br>
            I definetly would love to plan for every day being more easier. I Hate unexpected situations.<br>
            I would love seeing ahead if there are gonna be good weeks of rain to not goof up plant watering,<br> 
            or seeing if cold air is coming in a few short hours, so that the land don't suffer.
        </p>

        <h2>Scenarios:</h2>
        <p>
         1: Travelers from Washington, or Oregon, or Montana, or even Idaho needing to go to Utah or Wyoming, and<br>
         their route takes them through Preston. Wanting to know how the weather is when staying for the night.<br>
         <br>
         2: Tourists coming to the locations Preston shares with the world, and they are unaware of "slight" changes<br>
         to the temperature and instead of knowing it'll be sunny, the temperature will drop about 35 degrees.<br>
         <br>
         3: A Student looking for quick and easily readable weather predictions for a comparing climate project of<br>
         Idaho Cities.<br>
